# Instruction
Modify DB connection constants in common.php:
```
$dbhost = "localhost";
$dbuser = "root";
$dbpassword = "";
$dbname = "test";
```
Put all the code into Apache directory and run apache, then visit:
```
http://<host>:<port>/index.php
```
For viewing the demo, extract `picture.zip` to a folder named as `picture` alongside with `index.php`. And dump test.sql into corresponding MySQL DB. Then visit index.php again.
