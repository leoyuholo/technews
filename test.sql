(18, '[Mobile]A closer look at AcerCloud', 'picture/dsc01367.jpg', 'Acer unveiled so much hardware this week that it''s easy to forget it also teased a cloud-based storage service. In brief, AcerCloud, allows you to remotely access whatever''s on your Acer laptop, even if it''s asleep or in hibernation mode, and even if you''re not connected to the same WiFi network. Storage is unlimited, and you can upload music, photos, videos and documents. Also, it''s free.\r\n\r\nSo how does this work, if not over WiFi? Whenever possible, AcerCloud will try to create a peer-to-peer connection between your laptop and phone, but when that fails a security token inside the laptop allows the cloud service to play matchmaker between the notebook and the app, which is of course tied to your account. At launch, there will be separate mobile applications for music, photos, et cetera. It will be Android-only, though Acer reps tell us they intend to to create versions for Windows Phone and even iOS (assuming Apple approves it). They also say they''re considering developing a file manager where you can access all your content, and not just music or pictures. For now, at least, the discrete apps are intuitively designed, and the best part is that you can play back media inside of them. Good news for anyone not satisfied with their Android phone''s native music player.\r\n\r\nExpect this to start rolling out in North America and China in the second quarter, followed by a worldwide release sometime in Q4. It''ll also become an eventual staple on Acer PCs, including things like all-in-ones, but in the beginning it will be exclusive to Acer''s Ultrabooks. Until Q2 rolls around, though, you can head past the break for a short demo of the music app. We hope you''re not too sick of Lady Gaga.', 'acercloud, Android, android app, Android apps, AndroidApp, AndroidApps, ces, ces 2012, Ces2012, cloud, cloud storage, CloudStorage, laptop, laptops, ultrabook, ultrabooks, video', 1, '2012-01-14 18:53:00'),

By simply connecting your smartphone to the lightweight pad via MHL or HDMI-out, your phone gets transformed into a virtual laptop, albeit with a significantly lower-res display. It works just fine, however, if all you need is a larger screen that you can use for email or simple web browsing. But wait, there''s more -- flip the projector around, point it at a wall, and now your screen blows up to a max of 60 inches.

Texas Instruments'' Remi El-Ouazzane (VP of OMAP) just debuted an OMAP 5-based reference design (or "development platform," if you will) on our CES stage, a solid four years after OMAP 3 debuted on a nondescript Archos tablet. OMAP 5 brings along a pair of cores and plenty of power savings, a dual-GPU architecture and more raw horsepower than the average simpleton is used to handling in a single palm. We saw quite a bit of swiping through Android 4.0.1, and as you''d expect, everything looked decidedly snappy. 720p video at 30 frames per second is no real chore, with the platform capable of pushing 1080p material at 64 frames per second (130 frames per second without screen refresh limitations). Of course, with everything being hardware accelerated, we can''t feign surprise about its future on netbooks and laptops. To quote Remi:\r\n"This is the greatest platform on Earth right now... way ahead of Apple, and it''s the first Cortex-A15 (which runs 2x faster than the Cortex-A9) product on the market. When running two Cortex-A15 chips at 800MHz, it''s more or less the same performance as running two Cortex-A9s at 1.5GHz. You''ll see [commercially available products] ramping up with this stuff in late 2012 or early 2013.

We''re working on multiple form factors -- tablets, thin-and-lights -- and we think ARM is going to bring tablets to the masses."\r\nHe also made clear that he''s hoping to bring more and more Android into the enterprise, therefore accelerating the proliferation of the OS as a whole. Moreover, he told us to "expect" OMAP 5 in laptops and Ultrabooks running Windows 8, and alluded to the possibility of seeing the first ones by CES 2013.

On display, of course, you''ll find the S1081 Windows 7 tablet ($649), a refresh of the S1080 that steps up to a Cedar Trail CPU and adds an HDMI port in the process, but otherwise has the same specs and design. That''ll land sometime this quarter. That netvertible of the nostalgic ''90s variety would be the 10-inch T1006M ($559), which has Cedar Trail innards, 2GB of RAM, a 320GB or 500GB HDD and is "3.5G-ready." Availability details are hazy, as Gigabyte can''t specify timing until Intel reveals when Cedar Trail will ship. Suffice to say, Gigabyte expects it to hit the US this quarter.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the fare on display includes previously announced models just making their way to the states. These include the Booktop M2432 ($1,049 and up), a 14-inch, Core i5-powered laptop that can be plugged into a dock loaded with NVIDIA''s desktop-grade GT 440 GPU. The M2432, meanwhile, is a more imposing sort of machine, with a 15.6-inch, 1080p display, Blu-ray drive, 750GB 7,200RPM HDD and Core i7 CPU paired with a 2GB GeForce GT555M card. Lastly, there''s the dockable T1132N tablet ($1,169), which looks awfully familiar.\r\n\r\nAll told, we found ourselves primarily gravitating toward the Booktop, whose GPU-in-a-dock reminds us of the Sony VAIO Z, only with desktop-caliber graphics, and without the skinny laptop to go with it.

Compal shows off hybrid reference design', 'picture/compal-reference-design.jpg', 'We knew CES would bring a slew of Ultrabooks, but who could have predicted 2012 would be the year of the franken-gadget? So far this week, we''ve seen Lenovo''s IdeaPad Yoga, two hybrids from Gigabyte and a pair of 13- and 5.5-inch tablet prototypes from Toshiba. And that''s saying nothing of Intel''s Nikiski prototype and its promise of accelerometer-based gaming on Ultrabooks. With that as our backdrop, we have the Compal QAV20, a reference design sitting in Intel''s booth, alongside all the plain, months-old laptops we''ve already reviewed. From afar, it looks like the Samsung Series 7 Slate, but up close you''ll see it has a larger, 13.3-inch, 1366 x 768 display, along with a keyboard dock. On the inside, meanwhile, it packs a Core i5 ULV CPU -- the same guts you''ll find inside other Ultrabooks.\r\n\r\nIn our brief hands-on, we were stunned by how light the fiber glass device feels -- certainly, it''s much less dense than the similarly sized Yoga. The dock itself is home to various ports, including Ethernet, dual USB 2.0 sockets, HDMI and a headphone jack.

Sitting high on a shelf in Microsoft''s booth, hidden among the earthly clamshell laptops, is the Toshiba Portege M930, a prototype whose 13-inch screen slides down to completely cover the keyboard. All told, it''s awfully reminiscent of the ASUS Eee Pad Slider -- complete with a propped-up display and squat keyboard. The keyboard is so narrow, in fact, that Toshiba had to forgo a traditional trackpad and instead put a touch sensor and buttons over on the right edge. Though it''s a bit heavy for an Ultrabook, at 4.2 pounds, it has some Ultrabook-grade innards, including a Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, Intel HD 3000 graphics and a 256GB solid-state drive. Take a tour around the device and you''ll also find the usual array of ports: dual USB 2.0 sockets, HDMI, an Ethernet jack, an SD reader and separate headphone and mic ports.\r\n\r\nEven when we previewed the Slider we weren''t keen on sacrificing that much deck space in the name of bold industrial design and here, too, the keys feel unnecessarily crowded. The good news is that the hinge mechanism feels smooth and controlled -- not too tight, but rigid enough to inspire confidence in its build quality. That 13.3-inch screen also looks bright enough, though we imagine that 1280 x 800 resolution will be a turn-off for more than a few of you.

The cover has a brushed aluminum texture, with a shiny stylized VAIO logo stamped in the center. When closed, it''s not the thinnest Ultrabook, from what we can tell. It also has a glossy 13-inch display and Sony''s signature chicklet keyboard. Above the keyboard, you''ve got a row of small physical buttons, denoting power on / off, VAIO, Web and Assist -- familiar functions, all.

Intel is betting the farm on its Ultrabook concept as its hardware partners continued to push out the first real wave of laptops designed to take on the MacBook Air (who thought we''d be saying that four years ago?). Whatever your feelings on these devices, given Santa Clara''s billion-dollar advertising push, you won''t be able to ignore them this year. So, let''s take a look at five of the best products that rolled off the keynotes into the hands of our editors.\r\n\r\nAcer''s S5-shaped go on the Ultrabook gravy-train is a three-pound, 13.3-inch lappy that''ll turn on instantly, toting a sleek onyx black magnesium-alloy cover, Thunderbolt port and an SSD for easy flinging. Improving on the design of the S3, it''s the world''s thinnest Ultrabook, measuring just 15mm and feels significantly more premium. Sadly it''s not all gravy: it''s got a scratchy, shallow keyboard which we''re not sold on. What we do love is that the ports drop down from a motorized back cover -- Thunderbirds fans out there will adore it just for that.\r\n\r\nDell''s been waiting to show off how thin it could make a device and the XPS 13 didn''t disappoint. The company''s first Ultrabook tapers from 18 to 6mm and is made from aluminum and carbon fiber -- and with the attendant weight loss. The entry-level unit''s got a Core i5 CPU, 128GB SSD, 4GB RAM and a backlit keyboard. It reeks of understated quality, even though it''s only $1,000, but the port selection is pretty basic: it doesn''t include an SD card slot, which we think is an unforgivable crime in the year 2012. Corporate IT buyers who need to be conscious of roaming-employees'' luggage allowances: this is going to be a go-to product.\r\n\r\nSamsung''s revamped Series 9 shouldn''t be on this list, because it''s not an official Intel-sanctioned Ultrabook. That doesn''t stop us giving it honorary status because of its extreme thinness. The company spent last year listening to user feedback from the original Series 9 and threw out everything customers hated. Gone are the soft touch finishes and launch buttons, so the dimensions are more like those belonging to a 12-inch device. The 15-inch Series 9 is also special, mostly because it''s the only laptop that thin with that large a display.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the thin and light laptops named after Bond movie villains we''ve seen at this year''s CES, it was a tough choice between the Quantum Octopussy and HP''s Envy 14 Spectre. The latter $1,400 computer is a "premium Ultrabook," built from glass, weighing 3.79 pounds and rather sadly stretching the definition of "thin and light," considering it measures 20mm. It''s a hefty chunk of laptop considering the razor-sharp thickness of some of the other machines on offer. Fortunately, HP did something with all that extra heft, including a radiance display, NFC in the palm rest, Intel Wireless Display spanning and Beats Audio. Sadly, this device sails so close to the Intel-stipulated wind that it''s essentially just a laptop.\r\n\r\nLenovo''s IdeaPad Yoga is another device that isn''t branded as an Ultrabook, but that''s what it is: no tablet would weigh three times that of an iPad 2. The 17mm thick flip-over device can be used as a laptop, tablet or kickstand-tablet for movie watching. You''ll want to watch movies on this thing, too: it''s got a 1600 x 900 IPS multitouch display, unheard of in a device of this caliber. It''ll retail for around $1,000 when Windows 8 arrives, but even the prototype models scream of quality.

But that didn''t stop the mobile industry''s heavy hitters from giving us a taste of the year in wireless to come at CES. With Windows Phones finally getting LTE, Intel''s Medfield CPU making its handset debut, Sony synergizing under its mega brand umbrella and fringe manufacturers wowing attendees with stock Ice Cream Sandwich and super-thin profiles, it appears phone aficionados have plenty to anticipate. So, while you sit slack-jawed in front of that computer screen, let''s revisit some of the highlights of this past week. \r\nHTC Titan II\r\n\r\n\r\nAT&T threw a curve ball at its keynote when it announced this Titan refresh would be hitting the states with support for 4G LTE -- a much welcomed first for devices running Microsoft''s Mango OS. And as if access to those sweet wireless speeds wasn''t enough, HTC''s leapfrogged its US competition by beefing up the camera module on this 4.7-incher, bumping it to 16 megapixels with an f/2.6 lens and setting a new standard for imaging on stateside handsets. Unfortunately, that signature, elegant build has gone by the wayside, replaced here by a more traditional encasing.\r\n\r\nNokia Lumia 900\r\n\r\n\r\nIts LTE-packing thunder may have been stolen by AT&T''s Titan II announcement, but Nokia''s high-end Lumia still managed to hit a few high marks -- namely, for its 4.3-inch screen. The 900 is the first of Espoo''s Mango pack to tread into large screen territory and it''s headed for American mitts on AT&T sometime this spring (if the release rumors are indeed true). Inside, not much has changed, as we''re still dealing with a single CPU. So, if you were holding out for a dual-core WP7.5 phone, you''ll need to sit tight just a little bit longer.\r\n\r\nHuawei Ascend P1 S and P1\r\n\r\n\r\nThings are looking up for Huawei stateside. While brand recognition may still be somewhat low for the Chinese company, its fortunes could indeed about-face with the launch of its more premium Ascend line. The 4.3-inch P1 S and P1 are near identical twins, separated simply by thickness -- the former cuts a 6.68mm profile. And, perhaps heeding the call of Android fans everywhere, both phones are loaded up with stock Ice Cream Sandwich. If you like your devices unlocked and ultra-svelte, you might want to give these a go this April.\r\n\r\nLenovo K800\r\n\r\n\r\nLenovo certainly took us by surprise when it snuck this gem onto the showroom floor. Heralding the smartphone debut of Intel''s Medfield chip, the K800 is a heavily customized Android smartphone bearing 2011 specs, like a 4.5-inch 720p display, Gingerbread, 8 megapixel rear camera). In fact, users not well-versed in the finer aspects of CPUs, would be hard pressed to note the 1.6GHz revolution taking place under the hood. We''ve only just skimmed the surface of this Asia-only device, so stay tuned -- a US bow can''t be far off.\r\n\r\nASUS Padfone\r\n\r\n\r\nIt''s phone. It''s a tablet. It''s a... Padfone? No shockers here. We''ve had fair warning ASUS'' slatephone combo was headed to market, and have had plenty of time to warm to the idea. The concept? A 4.3-inch handset that neatly docks into a 10.1-inch tab, transitioning its display seamlessly to the larger screen and giving you more real estate for that ICS OS. It''s an effective solution for users that don''t want to port around two separate devices, and it also doesn''t hurt that the dock packs an extended battery.\r\n\r\nSony Xperia Ion\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter swallowing Ericsson hole and dispensing with the brand, Sony''s reorganized its mobile house. And with that new face comes a new era of premium handset design. The Ion is one of two smartphones issued by the Japanese giant that features solo Sony branding, a solid build (bye, bye creaky plastic) and some very respectable specs: 4.6-inch 720p HD Reality display, AT&T LTE and a dual-core 1.5GHz CPU.\r\n\r\nSony Xperia S\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by the Ion, the Xperia S appears poised to truly wear Sony''s new mobile crown. Featuring a transparent illuminating bar, which actually functions as the antenna, this dual-core handset is what we consider to be, bar none, the apogee of CES mobile phone reveals.

Regardless, we like the direction the company''s going -- and even if doesn''t see the light of day, we hope Acer has something else up its sleeve to take its place.\r\n\r\nTransformer Prime TF700T\r\n\r\n\r\nJust getting used to the Transformer Prime TF201? Well, it wouldn''t be a true CES without at least one company one-upping itself within a month of the launch of its signature product, would it? ASUS definitely fits the bill, as frustrated TF201 users worldwide groaned when it introduced the TF700T, a new Prime that offers slightly better specs. It''s a 10.1-inch device with a top-notch 1,920 x 1,200 resolution that takes advantage of a 1.3GHz quad-core Tegra 3, an 8MP rear camera with 2MP front-facing cam, your choice of 32GB or 64GB internal storage and Ice Cream Sandwich already loaded. The new Prime will be compatible with the same keyboard dock, so fortunately no new accessories are needed. Be on the lookout for the TF700T next quarter for a retail cost of $599 to $699.\r\n\r\nLenovo Ideapad Yoga\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it a tablet or a Ultrabook? Well, both, we suppose. Lenovo took to CES to introduce the Ideapad Yoga, a convertible Windows 8 device that will let you switch back and forth between the two form factors depending on your situation. The 3.3-pound laptop / tablet is a bit on the heavy side, but the Yoga, with its 1600 x 900 IPS display, holds a lot of promise for $1,000 once the OS -- and device -- are both ready to go later this year.\r\n\r\nPantech Element\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only did the Pantech Element become a decent and cost-effective LTE competitor to the ridiculously-priced HTC Jetstream on AT&T, it also added some benefits not found on any other tablet in the lineup. The first that comes to mind is the Element''s ability to shun water better than a bad pick-up line. Dunk the tab in one meter of water, walk away for thirty minutes and it still works without issue. Add this to a medium-sized 8-inch display, 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, 6,400mAh battery and a pair of rear and front cameras at five and two megapixels, respectively, sell it for a $300 price tag, and this tablet may have a pretty decent chance in stores when it comes out on January 22nd.\r\n\r\nOLPC XO 3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe One Laptop Per Child initiative has a new tablet by the name of XO 3.0, a customizable device that starts at $100. As the main driver behind the product is its inexpensive price point, don''t be expecting to see Transformer Prime-like performance here -- then again, that''s not exactly the purpose of OLPC, is it? Rather, delivering a tablet that offers minimum specs of 800MHz CPU, 1,500mAh battery, 512MB of RAM, Pixel Qi display, USB ports and 4GB of NAND storage, and the specs can be customized. We feel that even though it''s not a state-of-the-art tablet, XO 3.0 is worthy of a mention because of the OLPC''s overall mission.', 'acer iconia tab a200, acer iconia tab a510, acer iconia tab a700, AcerIconiaTabA200, AcerIconiaTabA510, AcerIconiaTabA700, asus, asus transformer prime, AsusTransformerPrime, ces, ces 2012, Ces2012, ces2012bestof, element, ideapad, ideapad yoga, IdeapadYoga, lenovo ideapad yoga, LenovoIdeapadYoga, marvell, olpc, olpc xo 3.0, OlpcXo3.0, pantech element, PantechElement, tablets, tf700t, transformer prime, Transformer Prime TF700T, TransformerPrime, TransformerPrimeTf700t, xo 3.0, Xo3.0, yoga\r\n', 1, '2012-01-14 20:21:29');
